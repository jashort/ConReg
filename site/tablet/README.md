Self-Service Kiosk Pages
========================

Self-contained site intended to be used at tablet based self-service kiosks. Attendees can enter 
their own information, which is added to the database and appears the same way as pre-registered 
attendees who have been imported.

As of 2014, this feature is functional but has not been used in production.
